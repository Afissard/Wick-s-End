## Game Concept

### Introduction

You are a little candle, alone in the darkness of a mysterious dungeon. You must keep the light on but also enough wax in order to survive. Your goal is to lit all the lamp of the level in order access the next one.

### Background

Is there any story ?

### Description

The ambiance is oppressing, the player must fear the dark.

I'm not an artist but I may add some concept schemas.
