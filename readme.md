# Dungeon Race

~~A coop partie game to reach the end of a procedural dungeon.~~

A race / score game to finish some platformer level (and beat bosses) and maybe also add procedural level. More information in `/gdd/game design document.md`.

## Roadmap

### Part 1 : technical demonstration

- [x] create a repository.
- [ ] create a [Game Design Document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design_document).
- [ ] create a basic platformer with *programer art* (probably gonna hurt the eyes but it will be useful for debugging)

### Part 2 : bare bone game

- [ ] add basic mechanic and enemies
- [ ] add object interaction (or stuff like that)
- [ ] implement game mechanics (dice, procedural map, save)

### Part 3 : tests with friends

- [ ] create a true server that run 24/7 that host a score table
- [ ] add a score checker to prevent cheat and hack (replay the full game from log file)

## Documentation & Contribution

Nothing for now, work in progress.
